### Built with

- [Semantic HTML5 markup](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout)

### What I learned

This is not a "new" learning but I noticed how hard it is in tailwind to "see" what the different variants of a components are. 

### Continued development

Nothing in particular comes to mind for further development.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwindcss grid docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/grid-template-columns) - This helped me with the grid layout
