                    I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I
                    learned were current, if not more so, in the company I
                    joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                    “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
                    I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
                    people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
                    the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I
                    enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best
                    - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the
                    course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a
                    Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                    “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of
                    code. I needed some structure from professionals who can
                    help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to
                    enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say
                    wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum
                    and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I
                    never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
                    project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning
                    to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
                    In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
                    example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me
                    land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                    multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
