### What I learned

This is my third "newbie" challenge so I didn't learn that much here, it was basically consolidating the learnings from previous challenges, I got the hang of things so I could focus a bit better on just getting the measurements right.

I became aware of the "Layout" section in the [style-guide](./style-guide.md) and how it might affect the breakpoints I used, so I added a `screen` breakpoint to the `tailwind.config.js`. I did not add the mobile breakpoint since this is the default breakpoint (mobile first).
