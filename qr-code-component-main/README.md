### What I learned

Learnings in general: Well it's the first project I did for Frontend Mentor so I learned (or rather still learning) how the process for submitting a solution looks. Also I set up github pages and build a pipeline for building all future Frontend Mentor projects (I use a single repo for all).

For this project specific I improved my knowledge of tailwind CSS, specifically how to customize colors, spacings and font settings. I also learned how to import a .fig file in the web version of figma since there is no "app" for Linux ðŸ™ˆ.

### Continued development

Well for now I have just applied the sizes from the figma design - I could change that to use the default tailwind sizes. Also I just set the width of the outer card element to the width defined in the design and I'm not sure if that is the "right" way.
