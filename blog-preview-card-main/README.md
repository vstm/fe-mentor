## My process

### Built with

- [Semantic HTML5 markup](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [@font-face](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)


### What I learned

I actually never used the `@font-face` css rule, so using this was new to me. Only afterwards I noticed the link to the Google Font page in the style-guide.md so I could have used the handy google embed code :D.

I wasn't sure how the hover should work it seemed to me that the whole card would have a hover state (which the shadow), or if there are two hover states (one for the card and one for the title/heading).
